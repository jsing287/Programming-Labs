# Programming-Labs
The labs created within this file are for the 1036 Programming-Fundamentals course for first year engineering students at Western University. As the laboratory number increases so does the complexity of the Java programs within each lab. Lab 00 covers basic applications of Java such as variable declaration and mathematical arithemtic with different variable types. Labs 01-05 display a use of if-else, and switch statements with the integration of for and while loops to achieve program goals stated within each class. Lab 06 covers the use of arrays within java programs. Lab 07 builds on the complexity of arrays by introducing the sorting of arrays using various algorithms and the use of objects within arrays. Lab 08 incompasses all the course materials and builds on the complexity of objects in java by introducing object hierarchys.
